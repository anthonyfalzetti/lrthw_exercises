   #A comment, this is so you can read your program later

   lesson_2/ex2.rb:2:43: C: Trailing whitespace detected.  
   # Anything after the # is ignored by ruby.

The two offenses are due to:   
1. No space between the # and the first character. To correct this I placed a space.  
2. An extra space after the comment. Solution is to remove extra characters even spaces.  

Can you find a key combo in RubyMine to comment out a line of code?  
`command` + `/`
