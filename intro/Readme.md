> What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

The three most essential skills are Reading & Writing, Attention to Detail, and Spotting Differences.

> Please explain these three skills in your own words.

 1. **Reading and Writing** is your ability to write code and interpret it.
 2. **Attention to Detail** is the ability to notice things, even the minute details.
 3. **Spotting the Difference** is the ability to see what is different in two things that look very similar.

> Why do you need to not copy and paste?

The reason we are doing this exercise is very much to train our minds and bodies. If we simply copy and paste we will exercise neither one.

> Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Practice is important, because it takes the theoretical and turns it into the practical by repetition. Persistence is important, because it will
become second nature in time. It will allow foreign concepts to become "common sense".
